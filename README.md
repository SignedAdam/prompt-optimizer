# Prompt optimizer

This project uses the OpenAI API to dynamically generate prompts for a set of tasks. The prompts are then executed (multiple times), and the results are evaluated against the optimal solutions. Then an analysis is made to identify what made the generated prompts good or bad for further improvement.
